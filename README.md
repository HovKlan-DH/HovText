# HovText

HovText is an application that removes any text formatting from the clipboard and it also works as a clipboard manager that can store and retrieve previous copied texts or images. Any text in the clipboard will be pasted as cleartext without any HTML code, font size, color or formatting etc. HovText remembers all copied texts and it is possible to restore the original formatting on the previous copied texts.

A typical scenario is to copy a qoute from the internet and paste this text into e.g. Outlook or Word. If the copied text has formatting then this will be pasted along also and that is often inconvenient as it spoils the current formatting for the document. Some applications has their own way of importing the unformatted text, but with HovText then ALL programs has this option and it works in the same way all the time.

You can say that it works basically in the same way as copying the formatted text to Notepad and then copy this text and insert in to the document + it will remove any whitespaces or new-lines in the beginning or end of the text.
