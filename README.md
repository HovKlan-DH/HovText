# HovText

HovText is a free open source Windows .NET Framework clipboard manager. With it you will be able to copy any text or picture and save it within the clipboard manager. It will remove the formatting from any text, meaning that if e.g. the text has been marked as bold in Word and you paste it to e.g. Wordpad then it will only paste it as clear text - the formatting will not be copied.

It is a REBOOTED edition meaning that it has been revived from the dead and it is completely rewritten from the legacy HovText version, available at https://hovtext.com/. The new edition is robust in terms of the clipboard chain and it should now work, in contrary to the old version.

I am by far no skilled C# developer and this is my first C# project. I am by nature a "spaghetti programmer" which you will be able to see in the source code but the important thing is that it works as intended ;-)
